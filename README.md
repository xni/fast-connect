fast-connect
============

If you are involved into development of several services or you are
a maintainer of any complicated distributed project,
you may find it useful to organize servers into groups
and give them descriptive labels.

For example like this:

![SSH servers](http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6607/57036399.1/0_74509_e20021e9_L.jpg)

# Installation

I haven't created a DMG archive yet, so the installator is missing:
the program must be executed from the XCode.

# Configuration

The config is stored at `~/.fast_connect` . It is a JSON file with a very
straightforward structure. Its sample may be found in the
[repository](https://github.com/xni/fast-connect/blob/master/.fast_connect.sample).
