fast-connect
============

If you are involved into several projects or you are the maintainer
of a complicated distributed projects, you may find it useful to
group server into groups and give them some descriptions instead of names.

For example like that:

![SSH servers](http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6607/57036399.1/0_74509_e20021e9_L.jpg)

# Installation

At the moment I haven't created DMG archive, so installation is missing:
program must be executed from the XCode.

# Configuration

Config is stored at `~/.fast_connect` . It is a JSON file with a very
straightforward structure.
